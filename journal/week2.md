# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Instrument Honeycomb
- Following along with the instructor, I instrumented the backend of my Cruddur application with Honeycomb. 
- I observed the traces were created as I refreshed the `/api/activities/home` page of the backend API.
- I added more attributes to my honeycomb instrumentation and ran custom queries to observe successful calls to the flask `/api/activities/home` route.
- The queries were saved for later use.
- Through [Honeycomb documentation](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry/browser-js/), I was able to instrument my frontend application and connect the frontend traces to the backend.

## Instrument AWS X-RAY
I instrumented the backend API to use AWS X-RAY.

## Configure custom logger
I configured the backend application to send logs to cloudwatch and I was able to view the log streams.

## Integrate rollbar
I integrated rollbar into the backend and observed its output.
