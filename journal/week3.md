# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

## AWS Cognito
- I created an application userpool using AWS Cognito
- I configured my frontend application to use AWS amplify and AWS cognito
- I refactored the user signin, signup, password confirmation, password reset pages to use AWS cognito
- I implemented JWT verification on the backend flask app and I was able to show conditional messages based on user authentication status.
- I implemented user logout to remove token in local storage
